Dag: Hi there Mr. Tarte!
Mr. Tarte: Ahhh..you startled me!
Dag: But you were looking directly at me...Anyway, I'm just really excited to finally meet you. I've been trawling the internet for years to try find out where you were.
Mr. Tarte: Well that doesn't sound stalkerish at all. Why was finding me so important?
Dag: I heard you were the best pie maker in the world and that you rarely took on apprentices. I reckon I'm pretty competent and wondered if you could help me become a better pie maker.
Mr. Tarte: Well...if you've come this far, it'd be a shame to send you packing. But as you know, I don't take on just anyone as my apprentice.
Dag: I know, that's why I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
Mr. Tarte: Whatever it takes aye? Well...as you've probably noticed by the empty plates, a few goblins and skeletons came and stole some of my pies as well as a few punnets of my best chips.  You look like you can handle yourself, so if you succeed in getting them back, I'll train you as my apprentice.
Dag: That sounds kinda dangerous and a little like a fetch quest to get me out of your hair, but I don't think I have any other choice...I'll do it.
Mr. Tarte: That's my boy. If you succeed, you'll receive the best training in the world and if you don't...well you were't really worthy anyway. Good luck!
Dag: This is going to be a long day...
